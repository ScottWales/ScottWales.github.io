I'm Scott Wales, a scientific programmer working at
[ARCCSS](http://www.climatescience.org.au), the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate
Systems Science as part of the [Computational Modelling Systems
team](http://climate-cms.unsw.wikispaces.net/).

Our goal is to help the Australian climate research community by assisting with
programming skills, training and creating new tools and services.

My particular interests are in the UK Met Offices's Unified Model, the
atmospheric model used by the Australian climate model
[ACCESS](https://accessdev.nci.org.au); developing cloud
services on the [NCI](nci.org.au) and
[NeCTAR](www.nectar.org.au/research-cloud) cloud infrastructures; and improving
the ways that scientists write code.
