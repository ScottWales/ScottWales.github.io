I'm Scott Wales, a scientific programmer working at the ARC Centre of
Excellence for Climate Systems Science as part of the Computational Modelling
Systems team.

Our goal is to help the Australian climate research community by assisting with
programming skills, training and creating new tools and services.

My particular interests are in the UK Met Offices's Unified Model, the
atmospheric model used by the Australian climate model ACCESS; developing cloud
services on the NCI and NeCTAR cloud infrastructures; and improving the ways
that scientists write code.
